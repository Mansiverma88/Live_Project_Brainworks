- A simple webpage is created, which has been divided into two section:
- Save- Created two text input fields in it: Firstname and Lastname, and a Save button
- Fetch-Created one text input field in it: Firstname, and a Fetch button
- When the user clicks on the Save button in the Save section, the data entered by the user gets saved in a Google Sheet using the url link genrated by API SheetDB by POST method 
- When the user enters a Firstname in the Fetch section, code fetches the corresponding Lastname from the same Google Sheet. The fetched Lastname is printed on the webpage using GET method.
